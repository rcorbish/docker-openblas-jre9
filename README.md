# docker-openblas-jre9
A Dockerfile based on java:9-jre with a compiled openblas library
(saves hours of wasted recompilation)

# Build the image

`docker build -t rcorbish/openblas-jre9 .`

Set the tag (`rcorbish/openblas-jre9`) to be whatever you want.

#### Running the image, not meaningful. It's meant to be a base for other apps

Good luck
